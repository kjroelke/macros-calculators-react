### Password Protected!

The calculator now has a very basic password protection so it can be publicly viewable and still inaccessible (as this is a private tool for Sara's business and a personal point of pride for me as a web developer).

Also added a quick AJAX request to ipinfo.io to bypass the password if we're at home so we don't have to type in the password (as that will most likely be 95% of use cases for this tool for now).

## v1.1

### The Calculator has a new UI!

I've updated the tool to have Macros By Sara official branding, as well as set the desktop version to be a 2-column flex-grid that utilizes position:sticky to keep the results in-focus.

_No more scrolling to see the numbers being crunched!_

### Dev notes

-   Now firing `myCopright()` inside `init()`
-   `myCopyright()` is now located inside of newly-renamed `utilities.js` module
-   Added docs in `view.js`
-   Refactored SCSS to implement `@use` in favor of deprecated `@import`

## v1.0

Init.
